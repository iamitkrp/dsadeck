  python:
    "Python is a high‑level, readable language widely used in scripting, data science, web backends, automation, and education. It emphasizes clarity over ceremony, so it’s great for learning algorithms quickly.\n\nWhy use it here?\n- Tiny amount of syntax to get productive\n- Huge standard library\n- Easy to reason about DSA problems\n\nKey ideas: indentation defines blocks, `print()` writes to stdout, and there’s no need for manual memory management.",
